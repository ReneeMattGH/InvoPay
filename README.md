## Quick Facts 🤓

- **Solves** — Indian SMEs wait 30–90 days for invoice payments → constant cash shortage  
- **Delivers** — Tokenize invoice as NFT → sell shares instantly → receive 80–90% cash in minutes  
- **Blockchain** — Stellar (super low fees, 5-second settlement) + Soroban (smart lending pools & escrow)  
- **Security** — OCR auto-check + file hash stored on-chain  
- **Status** — Live Testnet prototype (2026)

## The Problem in 3 Lines 🤔

- Small shops, freelancers, suppliers finish work → send invoice → wait months  
- Banks are slow, charge high fees, reject small amounts  
- Result → can't pay rent, salaries, suppliers → business struggles or shuts down  

**InvoPay changes this** — cash today, investors earn real yield tomorrow.
